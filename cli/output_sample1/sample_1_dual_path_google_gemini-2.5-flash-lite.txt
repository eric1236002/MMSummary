## Chapter Theme
The Nature of Principalities and the Art of Maintaining Power

## Plot Outline
The chapter begins by classifying states into republics and principalities, further dividing principalities into hereditary and new. New principalities are then categorized as entirely new or annexed to existing hereditary states, with acquired dominions being either accustomed to princely rule or to freedom, and obtained through various means: the prince's own arms, others' arms, fortune, or ability.

Hereditary states are presented as easier to maintain, requiring only adherence to ancestral customs and prudent handling of circumstances. The Duke of Ferrara is cited as an example of a hereditary prince who successfully withstood attacks due to his long-established rule. Such princes are less likely to offend, fostering greater affection, and their long reign diminishes motives for change.

New principalities, conversely, pose significant challenges. In composite states, where new territories are added to existing ones, the inherent difficulties of new principalities lead to instability. Subjects, hoping for improvement, often find their situation worsened, and new princes are forced to burden them with soldiery and hardships, creating enemies and failing to satisfy their supporters. Military strength alone is insufficient; a prince needs the goodwill of the populace. The swift loss of Milan by Louis XII of France is attributed to the deception of those who opened the gates and their inability to endure his mistreatment. However, provinces retaken after rebellion become easier to hold as the prince can punish offenders and strengthen defenses.

The ease of holding acquired states depends on their similarity in language and customs to the existing principality, especially if they are not accustomed to self-government. Integrating them involves extinguishing the former ruling family and maintaining old laws and taxes. Acquiring states with different languages, customs, or laws demands good fortune and great energy. The most effective strategy is for the prince to reside in the territory, allowing for prompt remedies to disorders and preventing exploitation by officials, thus fostering love or fear among subjects and deterring foreign attacks.

An alternative to direct rule is the establishment of colonies in key locations. Colonies are less costly than maintaining garrisons, offend fewer citizens, and the injured, being scattered, cannot retaliate. Maintaining armed men is costly, drains state income, and alienates the population. A prince ruling a foreign territory should support weaker neighbors and weaken stronger ones, preventing any foreign power from gaining a foothold. Discontented locals often introduce foreign powers. Subject states tend to rally to new powers due to hatred of the ruling power, and the prince must prevent these allies from becoming too strong.

The Romans are presented as a model for managing annexed countries: they sent colonies, maintained friendly relations with minor powers while humbling greater ones, and prevented foreign powers from gaining authority. They foresaw and addressed future troubles promptly, understanding that war is only deferred, not avoided.

King Louis XII of France's Italian campaigns are analyzed as a series of mistakes. His initial occupation of Milan was successful, but he erred by assisting Pope Alexander VI in occupying the Romagna, weakening himself and aggrandizing the Church. He further compounded his errors by dividing the kingdom of Naples with Spain, creating an associate and an alternative for ambitious individuals, and removing his own pensioner. The desire to acquire is natural, but doing so without the means leads to folly. Louis's five key errors were: destroying minor powers, strengthening a major Italian power, bringing in a foreign power, not settling in the country, and not sending colonies. A sixth error was the ruin of the Venetians, whose power would have deterred others from targeting Lombardy. Avoiding war by yielding territory is a mistake, as it only defers the conflict to one's disadvantage. King Louis lost Lombardy by failing to follow the principles of retaining conquered territories. The chapter concludes with a general rule: he who causes another to become powerful is ultimately ruined by that power.

## Key Character Dynamics
*   **The Prince (General):** The central figure whose decisions and actions determine the success or failure of maintaining power. The text explores the different approaches required for hereditary versus new principalities, and the strategies for managing acquired territories.
*   **Hereditary Princes:** Characterized by their established rule, less need to offend, and greater affection from their subjects. Their long reign naturally erodes motives for change.
*   **New Princes:** Face inherent difficulties in establishing and maintaining control, often creating enemies and failing to satisfy supporters. They require a combination of military strength and popular goodwill.
*   **Louis XII of France:** Serves as a case study of a prince who made critical errors in statecraft, leading to the loss of acquired territories. His actions highlight the consequences of poor strategic decisions, such as aggrandizing rivals and failing to consolidate power effectively.
*   **Pope Alexander VI:** His ambition and the Pope's growing power in Italy are presented as a factor that weakened Louis XII and contributed to the shifting balance of power.
*   **The King of Spain:** Becomes an associate in the division of Naples, ultimately benefiting from Louis XII's miscalculations.
*   **The Venetians:** Initially instrumental in bringing Louis XII to Italy, their own ambitions and subsequent weakening are discussed as a consequence of French policy.
*   **The Romans:** Presented as an exemplary model of prudent statecraft and military strategy in managing conquered territories.
*   **Cesare Borgia (Valentino):** Mentioned in a conversation, his understanding of war is contrasted with the French lack of understanding of statecraft.
