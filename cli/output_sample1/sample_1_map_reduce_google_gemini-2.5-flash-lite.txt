## Chapter Theme
The Nature and Acquisition of Principalities

## Plot Outline
The chapter begins by categorizing states into republics and principalities, further subdividing principalities into hereditary and new. New principalities are then classified by their origin: entirely new or acquired as an addition to an existing hereditary state. The methods of acquisition are also outlined: through one's own arms, the arms of others, fortune, or ability.

Hereditary states are presented as easier to maintain, requiring only adherence to tradition and prudent management. The Duke of Ferrara serves as an example of a hereditary prince who successfully retained his state despite adversity due to his long-established rule.

New principalities, particularly composite ones, are identified as inherently difficult to govern. The inherent instability arises from the populace's often unfulfilled hopes for improvement under a new ruler, leading to resentment and the creation of enemies among those who aided the prince and those who were injured by his actions.

The text then analyzes the swift occupation and loss of Milan by Louis XII of France, attributing it to the deception of those who aided him and their inability to tolerate his subsequent mistreatment. It notes that retaken rebellious provinces are harder to lose, as the prince can then punish offenders and fortify defenses.

The ease of holding acquired dominions is discussed in relation to shared language and customs, especially when the populace is not accustomed to self-government. The importance of extinguishing the former ruling family and maintaining existing laws and taxes is highlighted for integration.

Acquiring states with different languages, customs, or laws is deemed to require great energy and good fortune. The most effective strategy is for the prince to reside in the new territory to promptly address issues and prevent exploitation by officials, fostering either love or fear among the subjects. The presence of the prince also deters foreign attacks.

An alternative strategy of sending colonies to key locations is presented as less costly and less offensive than maintaining garrisons, with the injured being too scattered to retaliate. The principle of either treating men exceptionally well or crushing them to prevent revenge is emphasized.

The chapter then outlines the strategy for a prince holding a foreign country: supporting weaker neighbors and weakening stronger ones to prevent any foreign power from gaining a foothold. It notes that foreign powers are often introduced by discontented locals, and subject states may rally to a new power due to hatred of the ruling power. The prince must prevent these allies from becoming too powerful.

The Roman approach to annexed countries is presented as a model: sending colonies, maintaining friendly relations with minor powers, humbling greater ones, and preventing foreign powers from gaining authority. Their foresight in addressing future troubles promptly is praised, recognizing that war is only deferred, not avoided.

The text then critically analyzes King Louis XII of France's mistakes in Italy. His initial occupation of Milan is contrasted with his subsequent errors: assisting Pope Alexander VI in occupying the Romagna, which weakened him and aggrandized the Church; and dividing the kingdom of Naples with Spain, creating an associate and an alternative for his enemies. His removal of his own pensioner from Naples is also cited as a critical error.

The desire to acquire is deemed natural, but folly arises when it is pursued without the means. Louis's partition of Naples is presented as lacking justification, unlike his initial partition of Lombardy with Venice.

Louis's six key errors are enumerated: destroying minor powers, strengthening a major Italian power, bringing in a foreign power, not settling in the country, not sending colonies, and destroying the Venetians. The text argues that avoiding war by yielding territory is a mistake, as it only defers war to one's disadvantage. Promises made to the Pope are deemed secondary to strategic prudence.

King Louis's loss of Lombardy is attributed to his failure to follow the principles of retaining conquered territories. The text reiterates Louis's errors in Italy, emphasizing how his actions led to the rise of the Church and Spain, and concludes that he who causes another to become powerful is often ruined by that power.
