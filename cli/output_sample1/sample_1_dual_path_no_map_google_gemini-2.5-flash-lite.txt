## Chapter Theme
The Nature and Preservation of Principalities

## Plot Outline
The chapter begins by classifying all states and powers as either republics or principalities. It then focuses exclusively on principalities, dividing them into hereditary and new. Hereditary states are presented as inherently easier to preserve due to established lineage and customs, requiring only prudence and avoidance of extreme vices from the ruler. The Duke of Ferrara's resilience against the Venetians and Pope Julius is cited as an example.

New principalities, however, are identified as presenting significant challenges. Composite states, formed by annexing new territories to existing ones, are particularly difficult because subjects, hoping for improvement, are often deceived and find their condition worsened. New princes inevitably create enemies among those they wrong and alienate those who helped them, as their expectations cannot be fully met, and they cannot be treated harshly due to prior obligations. The rapid acquisition and subsequent loss of Milan by Louis XII of France serves as a prime illustration of these difficulties, highlighting how initial deception and subsequent ill-treatment lead to rebellion.

The text then delves into methods for acquiring and holding new dominions. States acquired and added to an ancient state are easier to retain if they share the same language and customs, requiring only the elimination of the former ruling family and the maintenance of existing laws and taxes. Conversely, acquiring states with different languages, customs, or laws demands great energy and good fortune. The importance of the prince residing in the new territory is emphasized, as it allows for swift resolution of issues, prevents exploitation by officials, and fosters either love or fear among subjects.

An alternative and often superior strategy is the establishment of colonies. Colonies are presented as cost-effective, offending only a minority and thus posing less of a threat than maintaining a large, expensive, and exasperating garrison. The chapter further advises that a prince ruling diverse territories should align with weaker neighbors and weaken stronger ones to prevent any single foreign power from gaining dominance. The tendency for discontented individuals to invite foreign intervention is noted, and the prince must manage these new allies carefully.

The Romans' approach to annexation is held up as a model: they sent colonies, maintained friendly relations with minor powers without empowering them, and subdued the greater ones, thereby preventing foreign influence. Their example in Greece, where they befriended some states while humbling others, is detailed. The chapter stresses the Roman prudence in considering future troubles and addressing them energetically, comparing unforeseen evils to a curable fever that becomes incurable if allowed to escalate.

King Louis XII's conduct in Italy is then analyzed as a cautionary tale. His ambition, fueled by Venetian desires, led him to Italy. His subsequent actions, such as aiding Pope Alexander in conquering the Romagna, weakening himself and alienating friends, and aggrandizing the Church, are presented as critical errors. The division of the Kingdom of Naples with Spain is another significant mistake, turning a position of sole arbiter into one of partnership and creating opportunities for rivals.

Louis's five key errors are enumerated: destroying minor powers, strengthening a major Italian power, introducing a foreign power, failing to reside in the conquered territory, and not sending colonies. The sixth error, consenting to the ruin of the Venetians, is also highlighted. The chapter argues that avoiding war by making such blunders is a false economy, as it only defers the conflict to one's disadvantage. The rise of the Church and Spain in Italy, facilitated by France, ultimately contributed to France's downfall. This leads to a general rule: he who causes another to become powerful is often ruined, as the beneficiary, through astuteness or force, becomes distrustful of their benefactor.

## Key Character Dynamics
*   **The Prince (New and Hereditary):** The central figure whose decisions and actions determine the success or failure of their rule. The chapter contrasts the inherent advantages of hereditary princes with the significant challenges faced by new princes.
*   **Subjects/Natives:** Their hopes, fears, and reactions are crucial to a prince's ability to hold a territory. Their willingness to change rulers, their potential for discontent, and their response to the prince's policies are key dynamics.
*   **Former Ruling Families:** Their elimination is often a necessary step for a new prince to secure a conquered territory.
*   **Allies (Minor and Major):** The prince's ability to manage alliances, particularly with weaker neighbors and by weakening stronger ones, is vital for maintaining power.
*   **Foreign Powers (e.g., Spain, the Church, Venice):** Their ambitions and influence are significant external forces that a prince must navigate, either by allying with them, deterring them, or preventing their undue growth.
*   **King Louis XII:** Presented as a case study of a prince whose flawed decisions and lack of statecraft led to the loss of his acquisitions.
*   **Pope Alexander VI (and Cesare Borgia):** Their aggrandizement, facilitated by Louis XII, is a key factor in the shifting power dynamics in Italy.
*   **The Romans:** Held up as an exemplary model of prudent statecraft and successful annexation.
*   **Cardinal Rouen:** Serves as a conversational foil to the author, prompting the discussion on French statecraft.
