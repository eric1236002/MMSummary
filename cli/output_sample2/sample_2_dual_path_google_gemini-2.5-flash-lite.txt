## Chapter Theme
The acquisition and maintenance of new principalities, contrasting methods of rule, the role of ability versus fortune, and the strategic actions of new princes.

## Plot Outline
The chapter begins by differentiating between two types of newly acquired states: those governed by a prince and his servants, and those governed by a prince and hereditary barons. It explains that states with a unified structure, like those ruled by a prince and his servants, are difficult to conquer but easy to hold once subdued, as the populace is accustomed to obedience. Conversely, states with powerful hereditary barons, like France, are easier to conquer by exploiting baronial discontent but harder to maintain due to the barons' inherent power and potential for rebellion.

The text then addresses the governance of conquered cities, proposing three methods for cities accustomed to freedom: ruin, personal residence, or establishing a friendly oligarchy. For cities accustomed to princely rule, it suggests that eliminating the ruling family makes them easier to control, as they lack experience in self-governance. Republics, with their strong desire for liberty, are presented as more volatile.

The narrative shifts to examine the qualities of successful new princes, highlighting the importance of ability and opportunity. Examples like Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, and Theseus are presented as leaders who, through their own efforts and favorable circumstances, established new orders. It is argued that armed innovators are more successful than unarmed ones, as they can enforce their will when persuasion fails.

The chapter then contrasts Francesco Sforza, who acquired and maintained his duchy through his own ability, with Cesare Borgia, whose power was largely dependent on his father's influence and fortune, ultimately proving unstable. Sforza is presented as an example of acquiring a state with difficulty but keeping it with ease due to his ability.

Cesare Borgia, also known as Duke Valentino, is then examined in detail. His rise to power through his father, Pope Alexander VI, is described, along with the obstacles Alexander faced in securing his son's position, including navigating the Church's political landscape and securing alliances, notably bringing the French into Italy to aid Borgia's conquest of the Romagna. Borgia's strategic measures to consolidate his power are detailed: weakening rival factions, gaining their adherents, and eliminating their leaders. His effective governance in the Romagna, including the use and subsequent execution of a cruel minister to win popular favor, is also highlighted.

Borgia's future plans to secure his position are outlined, including eliminating rivals, gaining the support of Roman nobles, influencing the College of Cardinals, and expanding his territory. He had made significant progress in these areas before his father's death.

The text emphasizes that despite Borgia's strategic brilliance and the solid foundations he laid, his ambitions were ultimately thwarted by the premature death of his father and his own severe illness. It is suggested that had he been in good health, he likely would have overcome the remaining obstacles. His actions are presented as a model for new princes, demonstrating how to secure power through a combination of force, fraud, and political maneuvering.

A critical analysis of Borgia's actions follows, focusing on his primary error: his choice of Julius II as Pope. The text argues that he failed to prevent the election of a cardinal who had reason to fear him, a mistake that led to his downfall. The principle that past injuries are not easily forgotten and that relying on new benefits to overcome old animosities is a flawed strategy is emphasized.

The chapter concludes by reiterating the contrast between those who rise through ability and those who rise through fortune. It suggests that a new prince must be prepared to lay solid foundations for their power, even after acquiring it, and that the actions of capable leaders like Borgia offer valuable lessons for new princes, despite his ultimate failure.
