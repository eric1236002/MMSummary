## Chapter Theme
The acquisition and maintenance of power, particularly in newly acquired states, examining the roles of ability, fortune, and the nature of governance.

## Plot Outline
The chapter begins by distinguishing between two types of principalities based on their governance structures: those ruled by a prince and his servants, and those governed by a prince and hereditary barons. It details the challenges of conquering and holding each type, noting that states accustomed to a single ruler are easier to maintain than those with powerful, independent barons. The text then explores methods for governing cities accustomed to freedom, suggesting ruin, personal residence, or the establishment of a friendly oligarchy. It contrasts the control of cities accustomed to a prince with that of republics, highlighting the latter's greater volatility due to their desire for liberty. The importance of both ability and opportunity in establishing new orders is emphasized through examples of historical figures like Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, and Theseus. The success of armed innovators over unarmed ones is asserted, as force can be used when persuasion fails. The chapter then contrasts Francesco Sforza, who achieved and maintained his dukedom through ability, with Cesare Borgia, whose power, reliant on his father's influence, proved unstable.

The narrative shifts to a detailed examination of princes who gain power through fortune or the favor of others, highlighting their inherent instability due to a lack of experience and loyal forces. Francesco Sforza's rise to Duke of Milan through his ability is presented as a successful model, contrasting with Cesare Borgia's reliance on his father, Pope Alexander VI. The complexities of Pope Alexander VI's efforts to establish Borgia's power are described, including navigating Church politics, securing French alliances for the conquest of the Romagna, and Borgia's subsequent efforts to consolidate his control. Borgia's strategies for weakening rival factions, gaining their adherents' loyalty, and eliminating their leaders are detailed. His effective, albeit cruel, governance of the Romagna, including the use and subsequent execution of a minister to win popular favor, is highlighted.

The chapter then outlines Borgia's future plans to secure his position against potential threats from a new Pope and opposing armies. These plans included eliminating rivals, securing the support of Roman nobles, influencing the College of Cardinals, and expanding his territory. His progress in these areas before his father's death is noted. The text attributes Borgia's ultimate downfall to the premature death of his father and his own severe illness, suggesting that had he been healthy, he might have overcome the remaining obstacles. His actions are presented as a model for new princes, demonstrating the application of force, fraud, and political maneuvering. The chapter concludes by identifying Borgia's critical error: failing to prevent the election of Julius II as Pope, a cardinal who had reason to fear him, illustrating the difficulty of overcoming past injuries.

## Key Character Dynamics
**The Prince and His Subjects:** The core dynamic revolves around the prince's ability to acquire and maintain control over his subjects, whether they are accustomed to obedience to a single ruler or possess a strong desire for liberty.

**The Prince and His Nobles/Barons:** The relationship between the prince and powerful hereditary barons is a crucial point of tension, as these barons can act as independent powers capable of instigating rebellion.

**The Prince and His Servants/Officials:** In principalities governed by a prince and his servants, the loyalty and effectiveness of these appointed officials are vital for maintaining order.

**The Prince and Fortune/Ability:** The chapter contrasts princes who rise through their own ability and effort with those who rely on fortune or the favor of others, highlighting the inherent instability of the latter.

**Cesare Borgia and Pope Alexander VI:** This is a central dynamic, showcasing how a father's influence and political maneuvering are used to establish and support his son's power, and how the decline of that influence leads to instability.

**Cesare Borgia and His Rivals:** Borgia's strategic interactions with rival factions, involving manipulation, elimination, and the co-option of their followers, are key to understanding his consolidation of power.

**Cesare Borgia and the Papacy:** Borgia's relationship with the papacy, both under his father and his successor, is a critical factor in his rise and fall. His miscalculation regarding the election of Julius II proves fatal.
