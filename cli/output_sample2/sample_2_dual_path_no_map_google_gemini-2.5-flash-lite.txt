## Chapter Theme
The Nature of Principalities and the Acquisition and Maintenance of Power

## Plot Outline
The text begins by posing a question about the stability of Alexander the Great's empire, attributing its endurance to the fundamental differences between two types of principalities: those governed by a prince and his appointed servants, and those ruled by a prince and hereditary barons. The former, exemplified by the Ottoman Empire, is easier to conquer but also easier to hold once subdued due to the ruler's absolute authority and the servants' complete dependence. The latter, like France, presents significant challenges in both seizing and maintaining control due to the inherent power of established barons.

The discussion then shifts to strategies for holding states accustomed to freedom, proposing complete destruction, personal residency, or the establishment of a friendly oligarchy. The Romans' success in dismantling cities like Capua, Carthage, and Numantia is contrasted with the Spartans' failure in Athens and Thebes, illustrating the effectiveness of extinguishing the independent spirit of free cities. Cities accustomed to a prince, whose ruling family is exterminated, are more easily secured as the populace, lacking a familiar leader, struggles to self-govern. Republics, however, with their inherent vitality and desire for vengeance, pose a greater challenge, requiring either destruction or constant presence.

The concept of "new principalities" is introduced, emphasizing the importance of emulating historical figures like Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, and Theseus. These individuals, while benefiting from opportune circumstances, possessed the "ability" to recognize and seize these opportunities, laying solid foundations for their rule. The text highlights that innovators face opposition from those who benefited from the old order and lukewarm support from those who might gain from the new, underscoring the necessity of armed prophets who can enforce their will.

The text further distinguishes between princes who rise through their own ability and those who rely on fortune. Those who achieve power through ability, like Hiero of Syracuse and Francesco Sforza, face difficulties in acquisition but find it easier to maintain their rule due to the solid foundations they build. Conversely, those who gain power through fortune, like many rulers in Ionia and the Hellespont, or through military corruption, find it easy to rise but struggle to retain their position due to their lack of experience and reliance on unstable factors.

The example of Cesare Borgia is presented as a case study of a prince who, despite possessing great ability and taking many prudent steps, ultimately fell victim to the "extraordinary and extreme malignity of fortune" due to the premature death of his father, Pope Alexander VI, and his own illness. The text meticulously details Borgia's strategic maneuvers to consolidate his power, including eliminating rivals, securing alliances, and establishing a strong administrative system. However, his ultimate downfall underscores the unpredictable nature of fortune, particularly his critical error in allowing the election of Julius II.

In conclusion, the text argues that while ability is crucial, the nature of the state, the methods of governance, and the unpredictable hand of fortune all play significant roles in the success or failure of a prince. The author advocates for a pragmatic approach, learning from historical examples and adapting strategies to the specific circumstances of each principality.
