## Chapter Theme
The nature of principalities and the methods by which they are acquired and maintained, distinguishing between those governed by a prince and his servants, and those governed by a prince and hereditary barons. The chapter also explores the challenges of holding newly acquired states, particularly those accustomed to freedom, and contrasts the stability of states acquired through ability versus those acquired through fortune.

## Plot Outline
The chapter begins by posing a question about the stability of Alexander the Great's empire and contrasting it with the enduring rule of his successors. This leads to an examination of two distinct forms of government: those ruled by a prince and his appointed servants, exemplified by the Turk, and those ruled by a prince and hereditary barons, exemplified by the King of France. The text then analyzes the difficulties in conquering and holding each type of state, noting that the Turkish model is hard to conquer but easy to hold, while the French model is easy to conquer but difficult to hold.

The narrative then shifts to historical examples, comparing the government of Darius to that of the Turk, and explaining Alexander's success in conquering and holding Asia. The text further discusses the Roman experience in governing states accustomed to freedom, highlighting the necessity of either destroying them, residing there, or establishing a friendly oligarchy. The examples of the Spartans and Romans are used to illustrate these strategies, with the Romans' success in holding Capua, Carthage, and Numantia through dismantling them contrasted with the Spartans' failure in Athens and Thebes.

The discussion then moves to entirely new principalities, emphasizing the importance of following the examples of great men like Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, and Theseus. It is argued that these individuals, through their ability and the opportune circumstances they encountered, acquired principalities with difficulty but maintained them with ease. The text stresses that innovators face opposition from those who benefited from the old order and lukewarm support from those who might benefit from the new, and that armed prophets are more successful than unarmed ones. Hiero of Syracuse is presented as a lesser, yet relevant, example of a prince who rose from private station through ability and opportunity.

The chapter then contrasts princes who rise through ability with those who rise through fortune. The latter, it is argued, have little trouble in rising but much in maintaining their power, as they rely on unstable factors like goodwill and fortune. Francesco Sforza and Cesare Borgia are presented as modern examples. Sforza, through ability, acquired and kept his duchy with relative ease. Borgia, despite his ability and the support of his father, Pope Alexander VI, ultimately lost his state due to the decline of his father's power and his own ill health. The text details Borgia's strategic actions in consolidating his power in the Romagna, including eliminating rivals, gaining the loyalty of his subjects, and managing his relationship with France. His downfall is attributed to the death of his father, his own sickness, and a critical error in the election of Pope Julius II.

## Key Character Dynamics
*   **Alexander the Great:** His swift conquest of Asia and the subsequent stability of his empire (under his successors) serve as a point of inquiry into the nature of state acquisition and maintenance.
*   **The Turk:** Represents a model of a centralized state governed by a prince and his servants, characterized by difficulty in conquest but ease in holding.
*   **The King of France:** Represents a feudal state governed by a prince and hereditary barons, characterized by ease in conquest but difficulty in holding.
*   **Darius:** His defeat by Alexander illustrates the vulnerability of a state similar to the Turkish model when faced with a decisive military victory.
*   **The Romans:** Their successful, albeit sometimes brutal, methods of holding conquered territories, particularly those accustomed to freedom, are examined.
*   **Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus:** Presented as archetypal figures who acquired principalities through a combination of great ability and opportune circumstances, facing initial difficulties but achieving lasting success.
*   **Fra Girolamo Savonarola:** Serves as a cautionary tale of an unarmed innovator who failed due to his inability to enforce his will when popular belief waned.
*   **Hiero of Syracuse:** A prince who rose from private life through ability and opportunity, demonstrating the principles of building a secure state on solid foundations.
*   **Francesco Sforza:** An example of a prince who acquired his state through ability and maintained it with relative ease.
*   **Cesare Borgia (Duke Valentino):** A complex figure whose actions are analyzed in detail. He is presented as a prince of great ability who laid strong foundations for his power, but whose ultimate failure is attributed to the extraordinary malignity of fortune (his father's death and his own illness) and a crucial miscalculation in the papal election.
*   **Pope Alexander VI:** Borgia's father, whose power and influence were instrumental in his son's rise, and whose death was a significant factor in Borgia's downfall.
*   **Pope Julius II:** The elected Pope whose ascension, due to Borgia's poor choice, ultimately contributed to Borgia's ruin.
