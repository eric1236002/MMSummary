## Chapter Theme
The Acquisition and Maintenance of Power

## Plot Outline
The chapter explores two primary paths to princely power: through wicked means and through the favor of citizens. The former is exemplified by Agathocles of Syracuse, a potter's son who rose through military ranks to become Praetor, only to seize absolute control by massacring the senators and wealthy citizens. Similarly, Oliverotto da Fermo, after military training, orchestrated the murder of his uncle and the leading citizens of Fermo during a banquet to secure his principality. The text posits that while such cruelties can achieve power, they fail to earn glory and distinguishes between "properly used" cruelties—swift and necessary for security—and "badly employed" ones that are persistent and lead to further violence.

The second method, a civil principality, is achieved through the support of either the people or the nobles, stemming from the inherent conflict between these factions. A prince elevated by the nobles encounters greater challenges in maintaining power due to their ambition and perception of equality. Conversely, a prince supported by the people finds it easier to govern, as their primary desire is to avoid oppression. The text emphasizes the importance of a prince cultivating the people's goodwill, as they offer a more stable foundation than the nobles. Nabis of Sparta is presented as an example of a prince who, despite external pressures, maintained security through popular support. The chapter concludes by addressing the risks associated with transitioning from a civil to an absolute principality, stressing the necessity for a prince to ensure his citizens remain dependent on the state and himself.

## Key Character Dynamics
The chapter contrasts the methods and outcomes of princes who seize power through violence (Agathocles, Oliverotto da Fermo) with those who gain it through popular support (Nabis of Sparta). It highlights the inherent tension between the people and the nobles as a fundamental dynamic in civil principalities, with the people being presented as a more reliable and easily satisfied base of support for a prince than the ambitious and potentially treacherous nobles. The text implicitly positions the prince as a figure who must navigate these societal divisions and leverage popular favor for stability.
