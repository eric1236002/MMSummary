## Chapter Theme
The acquisition of a principality through means other than inheritance, specifically focusing on two distinct paths: ascent through wicked or nefarious ways, and elevation by the favor of fellow citizens.

## Plot Outline
*   **Introduction to Principality Acquisition:** A prince can rise from a private station through two primary methods, neither solely dependent on fortune or genius. These are acquisition through wicked means or acquisition through the favor of citizens.
*   **Case Study 1: Agathocles of Syracuse (Nefarious Means):**
    *   Agathocles, from humble origins as a potter, rises through the military profession to become Praetor of Syracuse.
    *   He conspires with the Carthaginian general Amilcar to seize power.
    *   Agathocles orchestrates a massacre of the Syracusan senate and wealthy citizens during a public assembly.
    *   He seizes and holds the princedom without significant civil unrest.
    *   Despite military setbacks, Agathocles defends Syracuse and even attacks Africa, forcing the Carthaginians to negotiate and cede Sicily.
    *   Analysis of Agathocles' actions: his rise is attributed to ability and perseverance through hardship, not fortune or genius. His methods, however, are deemed cruel and lacking glory.
*   **Case Study 2: Oliverotto da Fermo (Nefarious Means):**
    *   Oliverotto, orphaned and raised by his uncle Giovanni Fogliani, is trained in the military under Pagolo and Vitellozzo Vitelli.
    *   He becomes a prominent military figure but desires to rule.
    *   With the help of conspirators and the Vitelleschi, Oliverotto plans to seize Fermo.
    *   He invites his uncle and the city's leaders to a banquet under the pretense of reconciliation.
    *   During the banquet, soldiers emerge from hiding and murder Giovanni and the other chiefs.
    *   Oliverotto secures the city by intimidating the populace and establishing himself as prince.
    *   He consolidates power by eliminating dissenters and implementing new ordinances, becoming formidable within a year.
    *   Oliverotto's downfall: he is eventually captured and executed by Cesare Borgia.
*   **Analysis of Cruelty in Seizing Power:**
    *   The success of rulers like Agathocles, despite their cruelty, is explained by the proper use of severities.
    *   Properly used cruelties are those inflicted swiftly, out of necessity for security, and not continued unnecessarily.
    *   Badly used cruelties are those that increase over time, leading to instability.
    *   A prince seizing a state should inflict all necessary injuries at once to avoid repeated offenses and win over subjects with subsequent benefits.
    *   A prince must maintain a consistent demeanor, as harsh measures in troubled times are too late, and mild ones will be seen as forced.
*   **Acquisition through Citizen Favor (Civil Principality):**
    *   A civil principality is obtained by a private citizen through the favor of his fellow citizens, not through wickedness.
    *   This type of principality arises from the conflict between the people (desiring not to be oppressed) and the nobles (desiring to rule and oppress).
    *   A principality can be created by either the people or the nobles, depending on who has the opportunity.
    *   Princes who gain power with the help of the nobles face more difficulty, as they have equals around them.
    *   Princes who gain power through popular favor find themselves with fewer rivals and more obedience.
    *   The people's desires are more easily satisfied than the nobles', as they only wish not to be oppressed.
    *   A prince is more vulnerable to hostile nobles than a hostile populace.
*   **Managing Nobles:**
    *   Nobles should be assessed based on their loyalty: those who bind themselves to the prince's fortune and are not rapacious should be honored.
    *   Those who do not bind themselves, either through timidity or ambition, require different handling.
    *   Ambitious nobles who shun commitment are dangerous and should be feared as open enemies.
*   **Maintaining Popular Favor:**
    *   A prince who rises through popular favor must keep the people friendly, which is easily achieved by not oppressing them.
    *   A prince who rises through noble favor must win over the people, often by protecting them, as receiving good from an expected oppressor creates stronger bonds.
*   **Case Study 3: Nabis of Sparta (Popular Favor):**
    *   Nabis, Prince of Sparta, successfully defends his country against Greece and Rome, demonstrating the strength derived from popular support.
    *   The proverb "He who builds on the people builds on the mud" is refuted when a prince, not a private citizen, commands courage and keeps the people encouraged.
*   **Transition from Civil to Absolute Government:**
    *   Principalities transitioning to absolute rule are vulnerable, especially when ruled through magistrates.
    *   Such governments are insecure as they depend on the goodwill of magistrates, who can undermine the prince in troubled times.
    *   Princes in such situations cannot easily exercise absolute authority and may lack trustworthy men.
    *   A wise prince ensures his citizens always need the state and him, thus securing their loyalty.

## Key Character Dynamics
*   **Agathocles and Amilcar:** A strategic alliance for mutual gain, where Agathocles uses Amilcar's military presence to facilitate his violent seizure of power in Syracuse.
*   **Agathocles and the Syracusan Senate/People:** A dynamic of betrayal and subjugation, where Agathocles manipulates and then violently eliminates the ruling class to establish his dominion.
*   **Oliverotto da Fermo and Giovanni Fogliani:** A relationship of mentorship and trust exploited for treacherous ends, culminating in Oliverotto's parricide.
*   **Oliverotto and the Vitelleschi:** A partnership in crime and ambition, where Oliverotto relies on their support to achieve his goals, and they are later implicated in his downfall.
*   **Oliverotto and Cesare Borgia:** A deceptive encounter where Borgia uses Oliverotto's own methods against him, leading to his capture and execution.
*   **The People vs. The Nobles:** A fundamental societal conflict that shapes the formation of civil principalities, with each group seeking to elevate a leader who serves their interests.
*   **Prince and Nobles:** A complex relationship requiring careful management. The prince must identify loyal nobles to honor and control ambitious or fearful ones to prevent them from becoming enemies.
*   **Prince and People:** A crucial relationship for stability. A prince who secures the people's favor through non-oppressive rule builds a strong foundation for his reign, especially in times of adversity.
*   **Nabis and his People:** Nabis's successful defense of Sparta highlights the power of a prince who can rally and maintain the support of his populace.
