## Chapter Theme
Methods of Acquiring and Maintaining Power

## Plot Outline
*   **The Two Paths to Power:** A prince can ascend to power through wicked means or by the favor of fellow citizens.
*   **Wicked Means: Seizing Power Through Violence and Treachery:**
    *   **Agathocles of Syracuse:** A potter's son who rose through the military to become Praetor. He then orchestrated the massacre of the senators and wealthy citizens to seize control of Syracuse. Despite military setbacks, he successfully defended the city and attacked Africa. His cruelties were noted as lacking glory but his mental fortitude and ability to overcome adversity were significant.
    *   **Oliverotto da Fermo:** After military training, he conspired with citizens and the Vitelleschi to seize Fermo. He invited the city's leaders, including his uncle, to a banquet where they were murdered by his soldiers. He then took control, eliminating opposition. He was eventually captured and executed by Cesare Borgia.
*   **The Proper Use of Cruelty:** The success of rulers like Agathocles stems from the "proper use of severity." Cruelties are properly used when they are swift, necessary for security, and not repeated unnecessarily. Improperly used cruelties, which multiply over time, lead to instability. A prince should inflict all necessary injuries at once and then bestow benefits gradually.
*   **Civil Principalities: Gaining Power Through Citizen Favor:** This method requires shrewdness rather than solely genius or fortune.
    *   **The Conflict Between Nobles and People:** Cities are divided into two parties: the people, who desire not to be oppressed, and the nobles, who desire to rule. This conflict leads to either a principality, self-government, or anarchy.
    *   **Princes Elevated by Nobles:** These princes face more difficulty maintaining power because they are surrounded by equals who hinder their rule.
    *   **Princes Elevated by the People:** These princes have fewer equals and more obedient subjects. The people's desire is simply not to be oppressed, making them easier to satisfy.
*   **Maintaining Popular Support:** A prince must keep the people friendly, as they are a more reliable foundation than the nobles. A prince can more easily defend against hostile nobles (who are few) than a hostile populace (who are many). The worst a prince can expect from a hostile populace is abandonment, while hostile nobles may actively rebel.
*   **Managing Nobles:** Nobles should be assessed based on their loyalty. Loyal and non-rapacious nobles should be honored. Timid nobles can be utilized for counsel. Ambitious nobles who avoid commitment are dangerous and should be feared.
*   **The Importance of Popular Support in Adversity:** Nabis of Sparta successfully defended his country against external threats because he had the people's support. The proverb "He who builds on the people builds on the mud" applies to private citizens seeking popular support for liberation, not to a prince who commands and keeps the people encouraged.
*   **Transitioning to Absolute Rule:** Principalities transitioning to absolute rule are vulnerable when governed through magistrates. This form of government is weaker as it relies on the goodwill of magistrates. A wise prince ensures citizens always need the state and the prince, thus guaranteeing their faithfulness.

## Key Character Dynamics
*   **Agathocles:** His dynamic with the senators and wealthy citizens is one of violent usurpation. His dynamic with the Carthaginians is one of strategic defense and offense. His internal dynamic is one of mental fortitude and resilience.
*   **Oliverotto da Fermo:** His dynamic with his uncle and the chiefs of Fermo is one of betrayal and murder. His dynamic with Cesare Borgia is one of eventual capture and execution.
*   **The People vs. The Nobles:** This is a fundamental societal conflict. The people seek security from oppression, while the nobles seek dominance.
*   **Prince and People:** A prince who gains power through popular favor must maintain this friendship by ensuring the people are not oppressed. Kindness from a prince they expected ill from fosters greater devotion.
*   **Prince and Nobles:** A prince must manage nobles by appointing and dismissing them, assessing their loyalty and ambition.
*   **Nabis of Sparta:** His dynamic with the people is one of reliance and security, enabling him to face external threats.
*   **Prince and Magistrates (in transitioning absolute rule):** This dynamic is one of potential weakness, as magistrates can undermine the prince's authority. The prince's ultimate dynamic is with the citizens, ensuring their continued need for the state and himself.
