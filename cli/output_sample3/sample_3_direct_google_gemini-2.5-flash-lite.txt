## Chapter Theme
The acquisition and maintenance of principalities through both illicit and popular means, with a focus on the strategic use of cruelty and the importance of popular support.

## Plot Outline
*   Introduction of two primary methods for a private individual to ascend to a principality: through wicked means or by the favor of fellow citizens.
*   Detailed examination of the first method, illustrated by the example of Agathocles of Syracuse.
    *   Agathocles, a man of humble origins and infamous life, rises through the military profession to become Praetor.
    *   He orchestrates a massacre of the Syracusan senate and wealthy citizens to seize power.
    *   Despite military setbacks, Agathocles demonstrates remarkable resilience, defending Syracuse and even attacking Africa, ultimately forcing the Carthaginians to negotiate.
    *   Analysis of Agathocles' actions, noting that while his rise was not due to fortune or genius, his cruelty and inhumanity prevent him from achieving true glory.
*   Further illustration of the first method with the modern example of Oliverotto da Fermo.
    *   Oliverotto, raised by his uncle Giovanni Fogliani, excels in the military under Pagolo and Vitellozzo Vitelli.
    *   He conspires with citizens of Fermo and the Vitelleschi to seize the city.
    *   Oliverotto invites his uncle and the Fermian chiefs to a banquet, where they are murdered by his soldiers.
    *   He then seizes control of Fermo, eliminating opposition and establishing ordinances to secure his rule.
    *   Oliverotto's reign is cut short when he is captured and executed by Cesare Borgia.
*   Discussion on the proper and improper use of cruelty in acquiring and maintaining power.
    *   Cruelties are properly used when they are swift, necessary for security, and not repeated unnecessarily.
    *   Improperly used cruelties, though few initially, multiply and destabilize a ruler.
    *   A prince should inflict all necessary injuries at once to avoid prolonged fear and resentment among subjects.
    *   Benefits should be dispensed gradually to prolong their positive effect.
    *   A prince must remain consistent in his rule, as harsh measures in troubled times are too late, and mild ones will be seen as forced.
*   Examination of the second method: a civil principality acquired by the favor of fellow citizens.
    *   This type of principality arises from the conflict between the people and the nobles.
    *   Princes are created either by the nobles (to control the people) or by the people (for protection).
    *   A prince who gains power through popular favor is more secure than one who relies on the nobles, as he has fewer equals and can manage his subjects more easily.
    *   The people's desire is to not be oppressed, while the nobles wish to oppress, making popular support more attainable and reliable.
    *   A prince can secure himself against nobles, who are few, but not against a hostile populace, who are many.
*   Analysis of the nobles' allegiances and how a prince should manage them.
    *   Nobles who bind themselves to the prince's fortune and are not rapacious should be honored.
    *   Those who do not bind themselves due to pusillanimity should be utilized, while those who do so for ambitious ends should be feared as enemies.
*   The importance of maintaining popular favor for a prince who rises through popular support.
    *   Such a prince can easily keep the people friendly by not oppressing them.
    *   A prince who rises against the people's will, with noble support, must win over the populace by protecting them, creating stronger loyalty than if he had been raised by their direct favor.
*   Illustration of the strength of popular support with the example of Nabis of Sparta.
    *   Nabis defended his country against external threats due to the people's support, despite internal opposition.
    *   The proverb "He who builds on the people, builds on the mud" is only true for private citizens, not for a prince who can command and inspire his people.
*   Discussion of the dangers faced by civil principalities transitioning to absolute rule.
    *   Governments relying on magistrates are weaker and more vulnerable, especially in turbulent times.
    *   Princes cannot rely on the loyalty shown in peacetime when the state needs its citizens in times of crisis.
    *   A wise prince ensures his citizens always need the state and him, thus guaranteeing their faithfulness.
